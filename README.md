# PyTorch-Absolutely-Basic-Workflow-MNIST
This repository illustrates the basic working of PyTorch on the MNIST dataset.
The dataset can be found here - https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.datasets.MNIST.html#torchvision.datasets.MNIST or can be directly imported as shown in the code.

It goes through step-by-step details with comments for each step, illustrating the workflow of PyTorch.
Enjoy the simple and neat code :))
